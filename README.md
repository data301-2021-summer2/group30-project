## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Due to the events that occurred in 2020, I am interested to see the statistics around police killings and this dataset allows me to find patterns around it. Furthermore, as I have a background in Psychology, I am curious if there are any enviromental effects on the occurance of police kilings. From the dataset, I am specifically interested in answering: Are there any risk factors regarding the occurrence of police killings?. For example, whether a certain age of the victim increases or decreases the likelihood for police killing to occur. I hope that by discovering patterns around police killings, I can educate myself and others on police killings and how to prevent or reduce the occurrence of future police killings. Lastly, I think that this dataset can be used to build a user-facing Dashboard as I can use it to find patterns and statistics that can be meaningfully visually presented.


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This data is taken from the Guardianâ€™s database on police killings and the census data from American Community Survey in 2015. The data consists of the victims' demographics, killing details, and characteristics of the location for police killings. The dataset consists of 15912 observations (34 columns and 468 rows). Columns 1-4 are victims' demographic, columns 5-21 are killing details, and 22-34 are the location characteristics. I have speculated and divided the columns into these three groups based on the column descroption given.
