## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Due to the events that occurred in 2020, I am interested to see the statistics around police killings and this dataset allows me to find patterns around it. From the dataset, I am specifically interested in answering: What are the statistics around police killings? From the data available in the dataset, does there seem to be a bias in the police system? Are there any risk factors regarding the occurrence of police killings? An example of a risk factor is the victim's age; does a certain age of the victim increases or decreases the likelihood for a police killing to occur? I hope that by discovering patterns around police killings, I can educate myself and others on police killings and how to prevent or reduce the occurrence of future police killings. Lastly, I think that this dataset can be used to build a user-facing Dashboard as I can use it to find patterns and statistics that can be meaningfully visually presented.


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This data is taken from the Guardianâ€™s database on police killings and the census data from American Community Survey for 2015. The Guardian collect their data using traditional reporting on police reports and witness statements by monitoring regional news outlets, research groups, and open-source reporting projects. They collect these data for the transparency and accountability of the law enforcement, as the US government has no comprehensive record of the number of people killed by law enforcement. The American Community Survey collect their data through surveys with the goal of providing information on a yearly basis about the US and its people. The dataset consists of the victims' demographics, killing incident details, and characteristics of the location for police killings. The dataset consists of 15,912 observations (34 columns and 468 rows). Columns 1-4 are the victims' demographics, columns 5-21 are the killing incident details, and 22-34 are the location characteristics; I have speculated and divided the columns into these three groups based on the column descriptions given.
